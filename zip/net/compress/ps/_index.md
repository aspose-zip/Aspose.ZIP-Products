+  Define folder path containing PS files.
+  Create Object of Archive.
+  Using the Archive object, load file with a full path using its CreateEntry method.
+  Call the Save() method and pass the compressed file name (full path) as a parameter.
+  Now you will get PS file as a zip file in a relevant folder without using any zip, rar or any other compatible program.
