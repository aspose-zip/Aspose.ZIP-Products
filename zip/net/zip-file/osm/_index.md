 A basic OSM document compression or decompression with
 [Aspose.ZIP for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/zip/net) 
 APIs can be done with just few lines of code.

+  Define folder path containing OSM files.
+  Create Object of Archive.
+  Using the Archive object, load file with a full path using its CreateEntry method.
+  Call the Save() method and pass the compressed file name (full path) as a parameter.
+  Now you will get OSM file as a zip file in a relevant folder without using any zip, rar or any other compatible program.

OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a huge collection of volunteered geographic information stores in different types of files, using different encoding schemes to convert this data into bits and bytes. OSM is a collaborative effort toward the creation of a free editable map of the world.  The primary output of this collaborative effort is geographic data rather than the map itself. The constraints on the use or availability of geographic information across much of the world triggers the need to create an OSM.  The data available from OSM is ready to replace Google Maps for classical applications (Facebook, Craigslist etc.) and default data for GPS receiver’s applications. Although data quality is diverse across the world yet OpenStreetMap data can be conveniently compared with patent data sources. Read More
