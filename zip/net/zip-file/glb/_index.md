+  Define folder path containing GLB files.
+  Create Object of Archive.
+  Using the Archive object, load file with a full path using its CreateEntry method.
+  Call the Save() method and pass the compressed file name (full path) as a parameter.
+  Now you will get GLB file as a zip file in a relevant folder without using any zip, rar or any other compatible program.

GLB is the binary file format representation of 3D models saved in the GL Transmission Format (glTF). Information about 3D models such as node hierarchy, cameras, materials, animations and meshes in binary format. This binary format stores the glTF asset (JSON, .bin and images) in a binary blob. It also avoids the issue of increase in file size which happens in case of glTF. GLB file format results in compact file sizes, fast loading, complete 3D scene representation, and extensibility for further development. The format uses model/gltf-binary as MIME type. Read More
