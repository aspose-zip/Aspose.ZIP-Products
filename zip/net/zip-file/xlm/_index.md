XLM, for Excel Macro, is a type of Spreadsheet files that are used to store Macros. From application point of view, a Macro is set of instructions that are used for automating processes. A macro is used to record the steps that are performed repeatedly for XLS file format and facilitates performing the actions by running the macro again.
