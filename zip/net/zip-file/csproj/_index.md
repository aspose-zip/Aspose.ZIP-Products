Files with CSPROJ extension represent a C# project file that contains the list of files included in a project along with the references to system assemblies. When a new project is initiated in Microsoft VIiual Studio, you get one .csproj file along with the main solution (.sln) file. If there are more than one assemblies in a project, there will be equal number of project files as well where the .sln file ties them all together as part of the project. The contents of this file define all the requirements that are required to build the project such as content to include, the platfrom requirements, versioning information, web server or database server settings, and the tasks that must be performed. Contents of a project file are arranged in XML file format and can be opened in any text editor for editing as well as viewing. It also gives a logical view to the project files for proper arrangement. Read More
