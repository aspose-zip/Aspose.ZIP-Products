 In order to compress or decompress STL file, weвЂ™ll use
 [Aspose.ZIP for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/zip/net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document compression and decompression API for C# platform. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.zip) 
 package manager, search for
 **Aspose.ZIP** 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 A basicВ STL documentВ compression or decompression with
 [Aspose.ZIP for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/zip/net) 
 APIs can be done with justВ few lines of code.

+  Define folder path containing STL files.
+  Create Object of Archive.
+  Using the Archive object, load file with a full path using its CreateEntry method.
+  Call the Save() method and pass the compressed file name (full path) as a parameter.
+  Now youВ will get STL file as a zip file in a relevant folder without using anyВ zip, rar or any other compatible program.

STL, abbreviation for stereolithrography, is an interchangeable file format that represents 3-dimensional surface geometry. The file format finds its usage in several fields such as rapid prototyping, 3D printing and computer-aided manufacturing. It represents a surface as a series of small triangles, known as facets, where each facet is described by a perpendicular direction and three points representing the vertices of the triangle. Resultant data is used by applications to determine the cross section of the 3D shape to be built by the fabber. There is no information available in the STL file format for representation of colour, texture or other common CAD model attributes. Read More
