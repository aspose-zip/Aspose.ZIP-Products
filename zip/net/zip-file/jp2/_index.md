 A basicВ JP2 documentВ compression or decompression with
 [Aspose.ZIP for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/zip/net) 
 APIs can be done with justВ few lines of code.

+  Define folder path containing JP2 files.
+  Create Object of Archive.
+  Using the Archive object, load file with a full path using its CreateEntry method.
+  Call the Save() method and pass the compressed file name (full path) as a parameter.
+  Now youВ will get JP2 file as a zip file in a relevant folder without using anyВ zip, rar or any other compatible program.

JPEG 2000 (JP2) is an image coding system and state-of-the-art image compression standard. Designed, using wavelet technology JPEG 2000 can code lossless content in any quality at once. Moreover, without any substantial penalty in coding efficiency, JPEG 2000  have the capability to access and decode the same content efficaciously into a variety of other resolutions and qualities. The code streams in JPEG 2000 is significantly scalable having regions of interest that provide the facility for spatial random access. Possessing Up to 16384 diverse components with the dimensions in terapixels, and precision that can be high as 38 bits/sample. Read More
