 A basicВ GEOJSON documentВ compression or decompression with
 [Aspose.ZIP for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/zip/net) 
 APIs can be done with justВ few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

+  Define folder path containing GEOJSON files.
+  Create Object of Archive.
+  Using the Archive object, load file with a full path using its CreateEntry method.
+  Call the Save() method and pass the compressed file name (full path) as a parameter.
+  Now youВ will get GEOJSON file as a zip file in a relevant folder without using anyВ zip, rar or any other compatible program.

GeoJSON is a JSON based format designed to represent the geographical features with their non-spatial attributes. This format defines different JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects and their joining fashion. JSON format represents a collective information about the Geographical features, their spatial extents, and properties. An object of this file may indicate a geometry (Point, LineString, Polygon), a feature or collection of features. The features reflect addresses and places as pointвЂ™s streets, main roads and borders as line strings and countries, provinces, and land regions as polygons. Using the GeoJSON, different mobile routing and navigation applications can indicate the coverage of their services. An extension of GeoJSON is TopoJSON that is smaller in size and encodes geospatial topology. Read More
