+  Define folder path containing EMF files.
+  Create Object of Archive.
+  Using the Archive object, load file with a full path using its CreateEntry method.
+  Call the Save() method and pass the compressed file name (full path) as a parameter.
+  Now youВ will get EMF file as a zip file in a relevant folder without using anyВ zip, rar or any other compatible program.

Enhanced metafile format (EMF) stores graphical images device-independently. Metafiles of EMF comprises of variable-length records in chronological order that can render the stored image after parsing on any output device. These variable-length records can be definitions of enclosed objects, commands for drawing, and graphics properties critical to render the image accurately. When a device opens an EMF metafile using its own graphics environment, the proportions, dimensions, colors and other graphic properties of original image remains same regardless of the opening device platform.
