XSL-FO (XSL Formatting Objects) is a powerful stylesheet language for formatting XML documents. The semantics of the bounded form of paper and print are expressed by XSL-FO when the dimensions are fixed. In contrast to HTML, which represents the semantics of the unbounded form of a browser window with variable dimensions. The XML documents formatted by XSL-FO are mostly used to generate PDF files. XSL (Extensible Stylesheet Language) is a set of feature complete W3C technologies intended to design for the formatting and exchange of XML documents and XSL-FO is a part of this language. XSLT and XPath are also other parts of XSL. Read More
