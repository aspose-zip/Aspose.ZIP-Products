Files with .CS extension are source code files for C# programming language. Introduced by Microsoft for use with the .NET Framework, the file format provides the low-level programming language for writing code that is compiled to generate the final output file in the form of EXE or a DLL. These can be created and compiled with Microsoft Visual Studio. Microsoft Visual Studio Express can also be used to create and update such files which is a free IDE. CS files are used for application development that can range from simple desktop applications to more complex programs. A simple Visual Studio project solution created with C# language can comprise of one or more such files. Files marked for inclusion in compilation are listed in the CSPROJ file which is part of the project and tells compiler to use the marked files. Read More
